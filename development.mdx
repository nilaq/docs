<Warning>
  The Riverslate API is still under construction and should only serve as
  reference for now. We are working hard to make it available as soon as
  possible.
</Warning>

## Base URL

The Riverslate API is built on REST principles. We enforce HTTPS in every request to improve
data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support HTTP.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
  https://api.riverslate.co
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an _Authorization_ header with the contents of the header being
`Bearer rs_123456789` where `rs_123456789` is your **API Key**.

```
Authorization: Bearer rs_123456789
```

## Response codes

Riverslate uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures,
and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Description                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `200`  | Successful request.                         |
| `400`  | Check that the parameters were correct.     |
| `401`  | The API key used was missing.               |
| `403`  | The API key used was invalid.               |
| `404`  | The resource was not found.                 |
| `429`  | The rate limit was exceeded.                |
| `5xx`  | Indicates an error with Riverslate servers. |

## Rate limit

The response headers describe your current rate limit following every request in conformance with
the [IETF standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers):

| `Header name`         | Description                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ratelimit-limit`     | Maximum number of requests allowed within a window.                 |
| `ratelimit-remaining` | How many requests you have left within the current window.          |
| `ratelimit-reset`     | How many seconds until the limits are reset.                        |
| `retry-after`         | How many seconds you should wait before making a follow-up request. |

The maximum number of requests that users can send is **10 requests per second**.

After that, youâ€™ll hit the rate limit and receive a `429` response error code.

To prevent this, we recommend reducing the rate at which you request the API. This can be done by
introducing a queue mechanism or reducing the number of concurrent requests per second.
If you have specific requirements, [contact support](mailto:support@riverslate.co) to request a rate increase.
