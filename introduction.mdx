  possible.

## Get Access to Riverslate

Riverslate uses API keys to authenticate your requests ([Learn more](/api-reference/introduction#authentication)). Each project within your organization
(such as production, testing, or experimental) will be assigned a unique API key.
To set up your initial project and obtain your first API key, please [contact support](support@riverslate.com).

After your projects have been established, you will be able to manage your API keys
independently through the developers section of the Riverslate Dashboard.
